JAMS
=========
`JAMS` is **Justin's Atomic Multitasking System**. It is allegedly a real-time
multitasking operating system for AVR XMEGA microcontrollers, but no one can
actually guarantee that it will work or provide any sort of realtime guarantees.

Most of the development time so far has been put toward developing a suitable
acronym.
